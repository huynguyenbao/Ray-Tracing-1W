# Brute Force Ray Tracing

![alt text](/image/finalResult.jpg "")

This project is implemented based on the web-book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Only sphere objects are supported in the implementation. There are 3 types of materials in the project: *Lambertian*, *Metal* and *Dieletric*.

There is NO Rendering equation in the implementation, just basically ray shooting and ray tracing.
